# OceanLab

Package of Python scripts for Oceanography - Version 1.0

## Synopsis

This lib was made by **Iury Sousa** (<mailto:simoesiury@gmail.com>) from Brazil to help him and other people that
needs to organize, process and plot CTD and VADCP data from cruise. Mainly directioned
to mesoscale oceanographers. The number of functions and subpackages and uses increased in process of time, and now
it's not restricted to mesoscale physical oceanographers.

Now this package have this subpackages below:

- **ADCP**
- **AO**
- **CTD**
- **DYN** 
- **EOF**
- **SEAPLOT**
- **utils**


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

There's still a lack of packages and tutorials for Python uses on oceanography. So, the OceanLab
project is based not just provide a package, but to create a teaching tool for oceanographers though.
The website with Python instalation and tutorials is still only available on **Portuguese**, but I'm 
working on english version. See the website on this link: [OceanLab][1]. Help me to 

## Installation

Clone this directory and run:

python setup.py install

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Everyone can contribute to this code. Some of functions was based on Filipe Fernandes or Cesar Rocha functions and some of them was created with help of Hélio Almeida and Wandrey Watanabe at Laboratório de Dinâmica Oceânica of University of São Paulo (USP).

Package of Python scripts for Oceanography - Version 1.0

This lib was made by Iury Sousa (simoesiury@gmail.com) from Brazil to help him and other people that
needs to organize, process and plot CTD and VADCP data from cruise. Mainly directioned
to mesoscale oceanographers. The scripts need to have installed some packages:
		  
		  Matplotlib
		  Basemap
		  Numpy
		  Scipy
		  Pandas
		  Gibbs SeaWater
		  SeaWater
		  
SUBPACKAGES:


		  
INSTALLATION:
I'm updating the package yet.

Clone this directory and run:

python setup.py install
	
Sorry for the lack of comments on some functions but I'm working on it and this is unstable yet.
Until now, the less commented script is the SEAPLOT.py

USAGE:

Some of directories has functions to import as: ADCP,AO,CTD,EOF,SEAPLOT and utils.

You can import as:

from OceanLab import AO

and use as:

AO.psi2uv()
