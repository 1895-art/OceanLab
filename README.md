# ocean
Package of Python scripts for Oceanography

This lib was made by Iury Sousa (simoesiury@gmail.com) from Brazil to help him and other people that
needs to organize, process and plot CTD and VADCP data from cruise. Manly directioned
to mesoscale oceanographers. The scripts need to have installed some packages:
		  
		  Matplotlib
		  Basemap
		  Numpy
		  Scipy
		  Pandas
		  Gibbs SeaWater
		  SeaWater
		  
And needs some bathymetry and climatology data in particular format (mainly .mat from Matlab).
You can find it on the Example directory.

INSTALLATION:
I will change it to get better but you have to clone the ocean directory and add to PYTHONPATH
the path to the directory that have it:

For example:
If my ocean directory is in my home folder (Linux). You can do it editing bashrc:

	oce=/home
	PYTHONPATH=$oce:$PYTHONPATH
	export PYTHONPATH
